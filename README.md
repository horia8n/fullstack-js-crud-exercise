# Plexxis Interview Exercise

Not much of an explanation to be given, this is an editable table.

I already had this script before as this is also an existing demo in my portfolio.

The difference is that in my demo I use redux and axios. I changed this so it works with fetch and no redux.

If you want to see the redux version please refer to <a href="https://github.com/horia8n/react_node_dbs">this</a> repo.

It is a complete CRUD example. The data comes from a db and the node contains hooks to Insert, Delete and Update as well.

This html table would work with any db table as the headers are not hardcoded. I actually made this demo as I thought it would be the best way to show my React-Node skills.

The node part uses pg driver and accesses the data from postgres.

I would have loved to change the color edit mode into a color picker and the boolean in to a checkbox but I really don't have the time.

I also took a look at the React Table and it looks like a tool that could save some time. I didn't use it here as my time is limited but if you guys insist and give me more time, I could...

Otherwise, YES, this is my main skill: COPY and PASTE. If you don't get the joke, you're not a programmer.

Cheers
